Hybrid Asynchronous Decomposition Sampler.

Minimal and general Python framework for building hybrid asynchronous
decomposition samplers. Enables users to easily experiment with different
choices (structural and parametric), thus tailoring the decomposition solver
algorithm to their specific problem. Helps with rapid development and experimenting,
not real time/wall clock performance (rather: offline performance).
